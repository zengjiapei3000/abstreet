In a
[15-minute city](https://crosscut.com/focus/2020/11/seattle-could-become-next-15-minute-city),
most residents can reach a variety of stores, restaurants, parks, and jobs
within about a 15 minute walk or bike ride. Part of advocating for a
bike-friendly city is evaluating the zoning laws and understanding where people
live in relation to where they work, shop, and meet friends. This tool is a
prototype letting you see what's 15 minutes away from a starting point. You can
explore the shops and estimate how much street parking and how many people live
within a walkshed.

## Feedback

The tool is quite simple right now. If you have an idea how this could be used
for advocacy, please
[get in touch](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/issues/393).
